#Vidzy: A MEAN stack tutorial#

###About###

This project is simply a result of a tutorial followed to learn the basics of the MEAN stack. It involves utilizing MongoDB and Angular to create an API and web interface for adding, modifying, and deleting video titles from a virtual catalog.

The tutorial I followed can be found here: [https://blog.udemy.com/node-js-tutorial/](https://blog.udemy.com/node-js-tutorial/)

This tutorial is technically outdated, and it suggests using an admin manager for MongoDB called Robomongo. Apparently, this software is incompatible with the new Mongo 3 version, and I had to improvise my creating my databases and collections using the mongo terminal application.

###Additions###

I never follow a tutorial exactly the same way it's shown; I always add some additional stuff in order for me to better learn every layer of the project. In this case, I added a "release year" alongside the movies' title and descriptions fields.

Since this project uses Bootstrap, I followed [another tutorial](http://blog.yodersolutions.com/bootstrap-form-validation-done-right-in-angularjs/) on how to properly run validation on field values in Angular, which is something the original tutorial didn't cover.
